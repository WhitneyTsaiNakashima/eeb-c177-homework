Creating files a different way
1. This created a file called my_file.txt without opening it to edit like the nano command did
2. The file is 0 bytes
3. When you need to create a blank file without editing it right away. The blank file could be used as a placeholder for a program to fill later.

Moving files to a new folder
mv sucrose.dat maltose.dat ../raw

Renaming files
2. mv statstics.txt statistics.txt

Moving and copying
2. recombine

Using rm safely
The output is:
rm: remove regular file 'thesis_backup/quotations.txt'?
This provides a double check to make sure we want to delete the file.

Copy with multiple filenames
cp: target 'morse.txt' is not a directory

List filenames matching a pattern
3. ls *t??ne.pdb

More on wildcards
cp *calibration.txt backup/calibration
cp 2015-11-* send_to_bob/all_november_files/
cp *-23-dataset* send_to_bob/all_datasets_created_on_a_23rd/

Organizing directories and files
mv *.dat analyzed

Reproduce folder structure
The first two sets will recreate the folder structure.
The third set will give an error because the 2016-05-20 and data directories don't exist.
The fourth set will make a 2016-05-20 directory with data, raw, and processed directories.
